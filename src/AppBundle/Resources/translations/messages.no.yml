  subtitle: Artist booking without costing time and fortune
  text: There are different occasions in life when you have to book an artist.<br>You could simply need to entertain your guests or find an unique present to some of your dear family members, friends or co-workers. At the other end of the market, we have artists. Some of them wish to make an extra buck of their hobby or to be discovered.<br>In 2018, we're introducing new marketplace to give artists an opportunity to promote and sell their services to the people nextdoor, next city or around the world. ARTIST NEXTDOOR provides a communication platform to establishing contact between artists and people like us.
